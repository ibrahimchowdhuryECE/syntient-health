# AI Medical Assistant Chatbot

An AI-driven, human-supervised appointment and triage system designed to optimize healthcare scheduling and prioritize urgent cases in large hospital networks.

## 🏥 Overview

This system addresses the critical challenge of appointment backlogs in healthcare by implementing intelligent triage and scheduling optimization. It consists of three specialized AI models working in concert:

- **Diagnosis Model (DM)** - Clinical reasoning and urgency assessment
- **Medical Assistant Model (MAM)** - Patient communication and data collection  
- **Clash Management Model (CMM)** - Scheduling optimization and conflict resolution

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Urgency-based prioritization** - Ensures high-risk cases receive timely appointments
- **Clinical safety** - Red-flag detection with immediate escalation to emergency care
- **Human oversight** - All critical decisions reviewed by medical staff
- **EMR integration** - Seamless connection with existing healthcare systems
- **Audit compliance** - Full traceability for regulatory requirements

## 📋 Documentation

- **[Product Requirements Document (PRD)](docs/PRD.md)** - Comprehensive technical specification
- **Architecture Overview** - System design and component interactions
- **API Documentation** - Integration endpoints and data contracts
